# NYU Course Coordinator
by Yuri Hwang

## What and Why?
NYU course coordinator is a software application that will allow NYU students to navigate through the stressful yet important process of class registration by providing scheduling tool along with the information needed for the decision.

## For Whom?
Any person who is registered as a student at NYU who wishes to register for courses through Albert may use the system.

## How?
* Users will be able to access course registration information and create their own schedules. 
* Each course information not only includes the basic infos on Albert, but also reviews on the course and the professor.
* For closed courses, users will be notified when the course becomes available again.
* Users will be able to set priorities in case of overlapping courses and the application will notify the user when the higher priority course becomes available.
* Users cannot register through the application, but will be provided live information.


## Scope
The project does not require too sophisticated skills like deep learning, but it is complicated enough that it needs both front-end and back-end programming connected to a different website.
